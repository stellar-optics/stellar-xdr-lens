## Linked issue

<!-- "Closes #123" / "Fixes #123". If there is no issue, say why one was not
     needed — a typo fix does not need one; a new command does. -->

## What changed and why

<!-- The diff already says what. Explain why: what problem does this solve,
     and why this approach over the alternatives? -->

## Test evidence

<!-- Show that it works. Paste the actual command output — not a claim that
     you ran it. For a behaviour change, show before and after. -->

```console
$ go test -race ./...

```

```console
$ # the command your change affects, with its real output

```
